# GAN_mnist
Generative_Adversarial_Network_keras_mnist_dataset

Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the MNIST dataset. GANs are a class of deep learning models that can generate synthetic data similar to accurate data. In this project, we train a GAN to generate handwritten digit images resembling those from the MNIST dataset.

Requirements
Before running the code in this repository, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (>= 3.6)
TensorFlow (>= 2.0)
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (optional for running and experimenting with the code interactively)

Results
You can visualize the generated images and the training progress using the Jupyter Notebook in the notebooks/ directory.
